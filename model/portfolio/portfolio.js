The point traveled only along the designated route and at the speed of the person driving the point (by walking on a treadmill). The point intersection query returned what ever data the user was interested in. For this reason, the application required forcing a loose coupling between the result set of the query and the application (thus avoiding datatype 'mis-match' errors). Finally, the data was routinely 'published' where students could write Java  classes and 'subscribe'.   The design pattern is an interface I designed, only after copying the idea from the design patterns of the Gang of Four ",
